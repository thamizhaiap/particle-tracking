# particle-tracking
This project is to track the particle motion. I aim to develop the code to track the bacteria's swimming the medium. In the first stage I have successfully located the particle.
The second phase will be tracking the particle with respect to time from the video captured using the custom made optical-traping-instrument with the capability of applying magnetic field and also UV activation light path. This instrument developed from the scratch by me :).
